# Exercise 8 - Adobe Reader

For this exercise, we will fuzz **Adobe Reader** application. The goal is to find an Out-of-bounds vulnerability in Adobe Reader 9.5.1.

## What you will learn
Once you complete this exercise you will know:
- How to use AFL++'s QEMU mode to fuzz closed-source applications
- How to enable persistent mode in QEMU mode
- How to use QASAN, a binary-only sanitizer

## Read Before Start
- I suggest you try to **solve the exercise by yourself** without checking the solution. Try as hard as you can, and only if you get stuck, check out the example solution below.
- AFL uses a non-deterministic testing algorithm, so two fuzzing sessions are never the same. That's why I highly recommend **to set a fixed seed (-s 123)**. This way your fuzzing results will be similar to those shown here and that will allow you to follow the exercises more easily.  
- If you find a new vulnerability, **please submit a security report** to the project. If you need help or have any doubt about the process, the [GitHub Security Lab](mailto:securitylab.github.com) can help you with it :)

## Environment

All the exercises have been tested on **Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS**. I highly recommend you to use **the same OS version** to avoid different fuzzing results and to run AFL++ **on bare-metal** hardware, and not virtualized machines, for best performance.

Otherwise, you can find an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS VMware image [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_m1x-SHcm7Muov2mlmbbt8nkrMYp0Q3K/view?usp=sharing). You can also use VirtualBox instead of VMware.

The username / password for this VM are `fuzz` / `fuzz`.

## Do it yourself!
In order to complete this exercise, you need to:
1) Create a seed corpus of PDF samples
2) Enable persistent mode
3) Fuzz Adobe Reader using QEMU mode until you have some crashes
4) Triage the crashes to find a PoC for the vulnerability


**Estimated time = 8 hours**

  <summary>SPOILER ALERT! : Solution inside</summary>

### AFL++'s QEMU installation

First of all, we need afl-qemu installed in our system. You can check it with the following command:

```
afl-qemu-trace --help
```

and you should see something like that:

![](Images/0.png)

If it's not already installed, you can build and install it with:

```
sudo apt install ninja-build libc6-dev-i386
cd ~/Downloads/AFLplusplus/qemu_mode/
CPU_TARGET=i386 ./build_qemu_support.sh
make distrib
sudo make install
```

where ``/Downloads/AFLplusplus/`` is the [AFL++ root folder](../Exercise%201#install-afl)

### Adobe Reader installation

Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install libxml2:i386
```

Download and uncompress ``AdbeRdr9.5.1-1_i386linux_enu.deb``:

```
wget ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/9.x/9.5.1/enu/AdbeRdr9.5.1-1_i386linux_enu.deb
```

Now, we can install it with:

```
sudo dpkg -i AdbeRdr9.5.1-1_i386linux_enu.deb
```

Then just type:

```
./opt/Adobe/Reader9/bin/acroread
```

Accept the License Agreement and you should see the Adobe Reader interface:

![](Images/4.png)

If you type

```
/opt/Adobe/Reader9/bin/acroread -help 
```

you can also see the list of available command line options

### Seed corpus creation

For this exercise, I'll make use of a corpus downloaded from **SafeDocs "Issue Tracker" Corpus**. You can find more information about this PDF Corpus [here](https://www.pdfa.org/a-new-stressful-pdf-corpus/).

Download and uncompress the corpus:
```
wget https://corpora.tika.apache.org/base/packaged/pdfs/archive/pdfs_202002/libre_office.zip
unzip libre_office.zip -d extracted
```

Now, we will copy only files **smaller than 2 kB**, to speedup the fuzzing process:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/fuzzing_adobe/afl_in
find ./extracted -type f -size -2k \
    -exec cp {} $HOME/fuzzing_adobe/afl_in \;
```


### First approach

The simplest way to fuzz closed-source applications is just running afl-fuzz with the **-Q argument**.

You need to take care when you run afl-fuzz, because ``/opt/Adobe/Reader9/bin/acroread`` is a shell-script. The real binary path is the following one ``/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread``.

But if you try to execute it you will get an error like this: ``acroread must be executed from the startup script``. That's why we need to set the ``ACRO_INSTALL_DIR`` and ``ACRO_CONFIG`` envvars. We will also set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to define the directory in which to search for dynamically linkable libraries.

Said that, you can run the fuzzer with the following command:
```
ACRO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader ACRO_CONFIG=intellinux LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:'/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/lib' afl-fuzz -Q -i ./afl_in/ -o ./afl_out/ -t 2000 -- /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread -toPostScript @@
```

And you should see AFL++ running:

![](Images/5.png)

Now, though, the fuzzing speed is really slow: around 7 exec/s on my machine. So, how can we improve the fuzzing speed?

And the answer is... using Persistent fuzzing!

### Persistent approach

As we see in [exercise 6](../Exercise%206), inserting the ``AFL_LOOP`` is the way that we have to tell AFL++ that we want to enable the persistent mode. In this case, however, we don't have access to the source code.

We can instead make use of the AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_ADDR to specify the start of the persistent loop. I advise you to set this address to the beginning of a function. You can find more information about AFL_QEMU persistent options [here](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/qemu_mode/README.persistent.md).

For finding an appropriate offset we can make use of a disassembler like IDA or Ghidra. In my case, I chose the following offset ``0x08546a00``:

![](Images/6.png)

There is an easier alternative to use a disassembler: to use **callgrind**.

First of all, we will install valgrind and kcachegrind with the following command line:

```
sudo apt-get install valgrind
sudo apt-get install kcachegrind
```

Now, we can generate a callgrind report with:

```
ACRO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader ACRO_CONFIG=intellinux LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:'/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/lib' valgrind --tool=callgrind /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread -toPostScript [samplePDF]
```

where ``samplePDF`` is the path of a PDF sample. It will generate a ``callgrind.out`` output file in your current folder. Now you can visualize this report running **kachegrind**. Just type:

```
kcachegrind 
```

and you should see something like this:

![](Images/8.png)

I recommend you to look at the ``count`` field in kcachegrind to identify functions that only get executed 1 time, and to try to achieve a **stability score over 90%** in afl-fuzz.
  
We will set also the **AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_GPR=1** envvar, that will save the original value of general purpose registers and restore them in each persistent cycle.

Now, we can run the fuzzer with the following command line

```
AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_ADDR=0x085478AC AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_GPR=1 ACRO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader ACRO_CONFIG=intellinux LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:'/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/lib' afl-fuzz -Q -i ./afl_in/ -o ./afl_out/ -t 2000 -- /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread -toPostScript @@
```
As you can see, it gives a x4 improvement in time of execution. Not bad!

![](Images/7.png)

For small projects, this approach might be enough. In a future exercise I will explain a faster approach: **write a custom harness**.

### Triage

In this last step we will try to find a PoC for our OOB read vulnerability.

Unfortunately, if we feed afl-qemu-trace with the crash file:

```
ACRO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader ACRO_CONFIG=intellinux LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:'/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/lib' /usr/local/bin/afl-qemu-trace -- /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread -toPostScript [crashFilePath] 
```

(where ``crashFilePath`` is the path of the crash file), all what we can see is a message like this

![](Images/10.png)

We can get a more detailes stacktrace using **QASan**. To enable it we only need to set ``AFL_USE_QASAN=1``. You can find more information about QASAN [here](https://github.com/andreafioraldi/qasan). Now we type:

```
AFL_USE_QASAN=1 ACRO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader ACRO_CONFIG=intellinux LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:'/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/lib' /usr/local/bin/afl-qemu-trace -- /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread -toPostScript [crashFilePath] 
```

and we will get a nicer stacktrace:
