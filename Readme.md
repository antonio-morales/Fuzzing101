Do you want to learn how to fuzz like a real expert, but don't know how to start?

If so, this is the course for you!

**10 real targets, 10 exercises.** Are you able to solve all 10?

## Who is the course intended for?
- Anyone wishing to learn fuzzing basics
- Anyone who wants to learn how to find vulnerabilities in real software projects.

## Requirements
- All you need for this course is a running Linux system with an internet connection. You will find a suitable VMware image in the exercises.
- At least basic Linux skills are highly recommended.
- All the exercises have been tested on Ubuntu **20.04.2 LTS**. You can download it from [here](https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04.0/#:~:text=15K-,ubuntu%2D20.04.2%2Ddesktop%2Damd64.iso,215K,-ubuntu%2D20.04.2%2Ddesktop)
- In this course we're going to use [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus), a newer and superior fork of Michał "lcamtuf" Zalewski's AFL, for solving the fuzzing exercises.

## What is fuzzing?

**Fuzz testing (or fuzzing)** is an automated software testing technique that is based on feeding the program with random/mutated input values and monitoring it for exceptions/crashes.

[AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL), [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) and [HonggFuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz) are three of the most successful fuzzers when it comes to real world applications. All three are examples of **Coverage-guided evolutionary** fuzzers.

###  Coverage-guided evolutionary fuzzer

- **Evolutionary**: is a metaheuristic approach inspired by evolutionary algorithms, which basically consists in the evolution and mutation of the initial subset (seeds) over time, by using a selection criteria (ex. coverage).

- **Coverage-guided**: To increase the chance of finding new crashes, coverage-guided fuzzers gather and compare code coverage data between different inputs (usually through instrumentation) and pick those inputs which lead to new execution paths.
