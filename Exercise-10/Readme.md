# Exercise 10 (Final Challenge) - V8 engine

For this exercise  we will fuzz **V8** Google’s JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. The goal is to find a crash/PoC for [**CVE-2019-5847**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5847) in v8 7.5.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  **CVE-2019-5847** is a vulnerability that may cause an infinite recursion via a crafted file.
  
  A heap-based memory corruption is a type of memory corruption that occurs in the heap data area, and it's usually related to explicit dynamic memory management (allocation/deallocation with malloc() and free() functions).

As a result, a remote attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library.

## What you will learn
Once you complete this exercise you will know-how: 
- How to use Fuzzilli to fuzz Javascript engines

## Read Before Start
- I suggest you try to **solve the exercise by yourself** without checking the solution. Try as hard as you can, and only if you get stuck, check out the example solution below.
- If you find a new vulnerability, **please submit a security report** to the project. If you need help or have any doubt about the process, the [GitHub Security Lab](mailto:securitylab.github.com) can help you with it :)

## Environment

All the exercises have been tested on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**. I highly recommend you to use **the same OS version** to be able to follow the guidelines. You can find an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS VMware image [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1925mpjbIL8ugc7WcOooIatYWnMKSX-g4/view?usp=sharing). You can also use VirtualBox instead of VMware.

The username / password for this VM are `fuzz` / `fuzz`.

## Fuzzilli

Fuzzilli is a (coverage-)guided fuzzer for dynamic language interpreters based on a custom intermediate language ("FuzzIL") which can be mutated and translated to JavaScript. It's written and maintained by Samuel Groß, saelo@google.com.

You can find more information about Fuzzilli at [the official repository](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli/)

### Install dependencies

To get your environment fully ready, you may need to install some additional tools (ex. Swift, Git)

Let's start installing the following dependencies:
```
sudo apt --yes install clang libcurl3 libpython2.7 libpython2.7-dev libcurl4 git
```

Now, we can download Swift:
```
cd $HOME
wget https://swift.org/builds/swift-4.2.1-release/ubuntu1804/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04.tar.gz
tar xzvf swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04.tar.gz
sudo mv swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04 /usr/share/swift
```

We also need to configure the PATH envvar:
```
echo "export PATH=/usr/share/swift/usr/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source  ~/.bashrc
```

### Install Fuzzilli

Time for download and build Fuzzilli:
```
cd $HOME
wget https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli/archive/refs/tags/v0.9.zip
unzip v0.9.zip
cd fuzzilli-0.9/
swift build -c release -Xlinker='-lrt'
```

## Download and build V8 Engine

### Download and setup depot_tools

V8 use a package of scripts called depot_tools to manage checkouts and code reviews. The depot_tools package includes gclient, gcl, git-cl, repo, and others. We can install it with:
```
cd $HOME
mkdir depot_tools && cd depot_tools
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
echo "export PATH=`pwd`/depot_tools:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source  ~/.bashrc
```

### Get V8 source code:
```
cd $HOME
mkdir Fuzzing_v8_75 && cd Fuzzing_v8_75
fetch v8
cd v8
git checkout 1ca088652d3aad04caceb648bcffef100bc4abc0
gclient sync
```

### Build and test V8:

First of all we need to install build dependencies:
```
./build/install-build-deps.sh
```

Generate build files using gn:
```
gn gen out/Release "--args=is_debug=false"
```

After that, we can compile with the following command line (it may take some time):
```
ninja -C out/Release
```

Now, we can check the d8 binary with:
```
./out/Release/d8 ./test/fuzzer/parser/hello-world
```

and you should see something like this:

## Fuzzing time

Compile v8 with coverage instrumentation:
```
cd $HOME/Fuzzing_v8_75/v8
cp ../../fuzzilli-0.9/Targets/V8/v8.patch ./
gn gen out/fuzzbuild --args='is_debug=false dcheck_always_on=true v8_static_library=true v8_enable_slow_dchecks=true v8_enable_v8_checks=true v8_enable_verify_heap=true v8_enable_verify_csa=true v8_enable_verify_predictable=true sanitizer_coverage_flags="trace-pc-guard" target_cpu="x64"'
ninja -C ./out/fuzzbuild
```

Move to fuzzilli folder:
```
cd $HOME/fuzzilli-0.9
```

First of all, we need to disable the creation of core dump files:
```
sudo sysctl -w 'kernel.core_pattern=|/bin/false'
```

Now we can run fuzzilli with:
```
swift run -Xlinker='-lrt' -c release FuzzilliCli --profile=v8 '/home/fuzz/Fuzzing_v8_75/v8/out/fuzzbuild/d8'
```

For a complete list of options, type:
```
swift run -Xlinker='-lrt' FuzzilliCli --help
```

If all went well, you should see something like:

## Do it yourself!
In order to solve this challenge, you need to:

1) Download and build the vulnerable version
2) Define a custom mutator to target the vulnerable code
3) Fuzz with Fuzzilli until you have a few unique crashes
4) Triage the crashes to find a PoC for the vulnerability
5) Send your PoC (see below)

## Challenge rules
The rules are as follows:
- Please, don't disclose your solution
- In order to be the winner, you must provide a valid crash/PoC file
- There will be 2 winners in total
- I'll release a new hint every week
- Send your solution by **28 February** to antoniomoralesmaldonado@gmail.com
- The winners will receive a coupon to spend in the [GitHub Shop](https://thegithubshop.com/)

## Hints
- 1º hint: 

```
git checkout 7.5.288.22
```
